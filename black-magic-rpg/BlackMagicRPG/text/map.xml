        You find yourself In front of you lies a grand gothic cathedral.
        The town appears to be made of black cobblestone mostly kept in
        good shape. As good as it could with the horses and people that
        walk these streets daily, anyway.

        Making your way north you find yourself in front of the cathedral.
        The grass around the church seems charred and you can hear something
        coming from inside.
